## Overview

The **Semantic Rate–Distortion Energy Law (SRED Law)** establishes a fundamental
thermodynamic lower bound on the minimum unavoidable energy dissipation required
to preserve *semantic meaning* over long time horizons.

The law applies to any system that:
- Preserves semantic meaning operationally (via observable behavior),
- Operates for long or unbounded time,
- Exists in a thermodynamic universe.

It shows that **preserving meaning itself has an irreducible energetic cost**,
independent of implementation details, hardware efficiency, or internal
representation.

## Core Statement (Informal)

The minimum thermodynamic cost of preserving meaning over time is exactly
proportional to the semantic information rate that is preserved.

Exact semantic preservation arises as the zero-distortion limit of this law.
